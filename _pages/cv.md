* Ph.D in Neuroengineering, Brown University, 2015 - present
* Bachelor of Science in Physics, University of Iceland, 2012 - 2015
* Exchange Program, Waseda University, 2014 - 2015

Work experience
======

* **Sep 2015 - Now:** Ph.D. Student, <i>Brown University</i>
  * Research in Dr. Arto Nurmikko's Neuroengineering and Nanophotonics Lab.
  
  
* **Jan 2015 - May 2015:** Student Researcher, <i>Waseda University</i>
  *	Performed data analysis on raw voltage data collected from excited neuronal cell cultures.
  *	Identified key behaviors in neuronal firing patterns I was able to tie to specific ion-channels using ion-blockers.


* **May 2014 - Sep 2014:** Summer Research Intern, <i>University of Iceland</i>
  *	Added functionality for new types of molecular interactions to custom Monte Carlo plasma simulation software.
  *	Performed extensive simulations on a local supercomputing cluster for investigation of certain plasma phenomena.
