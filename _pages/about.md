I am a Ph.D student working in the [Neuroengineering and Nanophotonics Laboratory](http://nurmikko.engin.brown.edu/) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/). I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Physics from [the University of Iceland](https://english.hi.is/university_of_iceland) in 2015, with a year of exchange studies at Waseda University where I did patch-clamp electrophysiology in the Ishiwata lab. 

My current work involves the use of various microfabrication tools and techniques to process micro-scale implantable electronic devices for interfacing with the nervous system. I also do subsequent testing of these devices in rodents to assess their in-vivo functionality.

Throughout my studies, I have put a considerable emphasis on computer science coursework. In addition to my academic work experiences, I have done a lot of programming in a competitive setting ([see f.e. rank 32 this round of Kickstart](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/round/000000000019ffc8)), and I have got a few meaty projects under my belt (some of which are available under the [projects](https://ssigurdsson.github.io/projects/) section above).
