I am a Ph.D student in the [Biomedical Engineering Department](https://www.brown.edu/academics/biomedical-engineering/research) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/). My work involves the use of various microfabrication tools and techniques to produce and process micro-scale implantable electronic devices for interfacing with the nervous system. I then test these devices in rodents to assess their functionality and efficacy.

I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Physics from [the University of Iceland](https://english.hi.is/university_of_iceland) in 2015.
