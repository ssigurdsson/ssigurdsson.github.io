I am a Ph.D student working in the [Neuroengineering and Nanophotonics Laboratory](http://nurmikko.engin.brown.edu/) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/). I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Physics from [the University of Iceland](https://english.hi.is/university_of_iceland) in 2015, with a year of exchange studies at Waseda University where I did patch-clamp electrophysiology in the Ishiwata lab. My current work involves the use of various microfabrication tools and techniques to process micro-scale implantable electronic devices for interfacing with the nervous system. I also do subsequent testing of these devices in rodents to assess their in-vivo functionality.

I am also interested in computer programming. A list of my projects may be found under the Projects section above.
