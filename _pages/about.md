I am a Ph.D student in the [Biomedical Engineering Department](https://www.brown.edu/academics/biomedical-engineering/research) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/). My work involves the use of various microfabrication tools and techniques to produce and process micro-scale implantable electronic devices for interfacing with the nervous system. I also do subsequent testing of these devices in rodents to assess their in-vivo functionality and efficacy.

I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Physics from [the University of Iceland](https://english.hi.is/university_of_iceland) in 2015, with a year of exchange studies at Waseda University where I did patch-clamp work in the Ishiwata lab.
