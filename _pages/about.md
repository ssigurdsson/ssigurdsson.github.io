I am currently employed as a full-stack software engineer at a fintech startup in the bay area. Here, you may find my resume and some of the personal projects I've worked on throughout the years.

I did my doctorate in the [Neuroengineering and Nanophotonics Laboratory](http://nurmikko.engin.brown.edu/) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), and received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Physics from [the University of Iceland](https://english.hi.is/university_of_iceland) in 2015.
