Net-Blob, Netcode Visualization Tool
------
* Networking project in Python within the context of an online multiplayer game.
* This project aims to provide insight into the networking of online multiplayer games, or "netcode" as it is broadly termed.
* An authoritative server-client model enables gameplay resembling that of the online game Agar.io, which is accompanied by controls that allow the user to simulate poor network conditions. As the subject of this project would suggest, the client employs a number of commonly used techniques for reducing the negative impact of such poor conditions.

Pick & Place Machine Automation
------
* Computer Vision project in Python.
* Automated the sorting of sub-mm size silicon dies by pick&place machine using the OpenCV library.
* The script controls the software that accompanies the pick&place machine, moving a microscope objective accross the plane in which the unsorted devices lie, registering the locations of each device and checking whether the device is face-up or -down. The script then spits out files that may be uploaded to the pick&place software for automated processing of the devices into ordered arrays.

ARM32 Processor Implemented on a Cyclone II FPGA
------
* HDL project written in in Verilog.
* Designed and Implemented a 5-stage pipelined ARM32 processor on an FPGA for course ENGN1640 at Brown University.
* Achieved the highest processor frequency of any student for the year of 2017.
