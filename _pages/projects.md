Automated Pick & Place Processing
------
* Computer Vision project in Python
* Automated the sorting of sub-mm size silicon dies by Pick & Place machine using the OpenCV library
* The script controls the software that accompanies the P&P machine, moving the microscope camera accross the plane in which the unsorted devices lie, registering the locations of each device and checking whether that device is face-up or -down. The script then spits out files that may be uploaded to the P&P software for automated processing of the devices into ordered arrays.

ARM32 Processor Implemented on a Cyclone II
------
* FPGA Programming in Verilog
* Implemented a 5-stage pipelined ARM32 processor for course ENGN1640 at Brown University
* Achieved the highest processor frequency of any student for the year 2017
