Pick & Place Machine Automation
------
* Computer Vision project in Python.
* Automated the sorting of sub-mm size silicon dies by pick&place machine using the OpenCV library.
* The script controls the software that accompanies the pick&place machine, moving a microscope objective accross the plane in which the unsorted devices lie, registering the locations of each device and checking whether the device is face-up or -down. The script then spits out files that may be uploaded to the pick&place software for automated processing of the devices into ordered arrays.

ARM32 Processor Implemented on a Cyclone II FPGA
------
* HDL project written in in Verilog.
* Designed and Implemented a 5-stage pipelined ARM32 processor on an FPGA for course ENGN1640 at Brown University.
* Achieved the highest processor frequency of any student for the year of 2017.
